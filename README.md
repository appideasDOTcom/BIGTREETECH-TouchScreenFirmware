## printerX touchscreen firmware

This is a fork of BigTreeTech's TouchScreenFirmware repository with ostmoxy's desired changes for printerX

This should work with any printer that uses a BTT TFT24, but if you're not using printerX, you probably want to start with the generic version of this firmware from BTT. Original source code is here:
https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-TouchScreenFirmware

Currently working source code is in the printerX branch
